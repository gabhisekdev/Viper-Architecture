# Advance VIPER Implementation

This project demonstrates usage of VIPER design pattern in a full fledged practical application which involves API request, database storage and designing UI components.


## TravelTracker

A travel tracker which searches you paths from your destination location to another location. It uses Google Directions API to fetch the best driving route between two locations. The project is architectured using [VIPER](https://github.com/GABHISEKBUNTY/Viper-Architecture).

If you are not familiar with VIPER, please refer this [DemoApp](https://github.com/GABHISEKBUNTY/Viper-Architecture/tree/master/ViperDemo) and [explannation](https://github.com/GABHISEKBUNTY/Viper-Architecture) before proceeding.

We will go through the basic structurising and code flow for the whole application.


## App Flow

The flow is almost identical to that provided in [DemoApp](https://github.com/GABHISEKBUNTY/Viper-Architecture/tree/master/ViperDemo) and its description. And that is the charm of VIPER, that any project which follows this architecture almost has the same flow and code structurisation.

I have made only one module i.e the Search Module consisting of two pages to showcase how to structurise multi-paged module.
